These should refer to all/most of the major changes. There may be some refactoring that I forgot to mention.
Line numbers refer to original file (before my changes).

ConsolePrinter.cs
-----------------
Remove this. It is not needed. Doing Console.WriteLine("String to print") will have the same effect.

Program.cs
----------
Line 13: Remove static string[] results = new string[50]; No need to store the results of method calls. You can just have those methods return
their results and print them from that.

Line 14: Remove static char key; Don't need this to be global.	
        
Line 15: Remove static Tuple<string, string> names; Don't need this to be global.

Line 16: Remove static ConsolePrinter printer = new ConsolePrinter(); We don't need this printer class to write output the the console.

Line 21 - 23: Move check for question mark key inside the loop, so we can show help whenever we want, not just at the beginning. Also, we are not 
required to push ? before doing other commands if we already know what the commands are.

Line 40: Refactor category entry, and number of jokes entry. This doesn't work as intended. Category entry should be done before entering the number of jokes.
In this same area: Input for number of jokes should be validated. It should be a numeric value between 1 - 9. Any other character(s) should not work, but also not
crash the program.

Line 62: PrintResults should take a parameter and print based on that, not based on a global variable.

Line 67: Don't need GetEnteredKey method. char key = Console.ReadKey().KeyChar will do exactly the same thing without having to convert between ConsoleKeyInfo
and char. It will also let you check for '?', which ConsoleKeyInfo does not.

Lines 110, 116, 122: Refactor GetRandomJokes, GetCategories and GetNames (Rename to GetRandomName). They should all return their values rather
than setting global variables.

JsonFeed.cs
-----------
Line 13: Move HttpClient client and set it's baseUrl in constructor. Then you can just use the same client for all methods, rather than creating a new
one and setting the url each time.

Line 16: Remove parameter "int results" from constructor. It is never used.

Line 21: Add parameter "int numberOfJokes" to GetRandomoJokes, otherwise we won't know how many jokes to generate.

Line 25: Rename url to something more descriptive, like requestUrl.

Line 30-32: These can be done in a single line.

Line 35-42: This needs to be done multiple times, based on input of number of jokes to generate. 

Line 39-42: All of this can be done with a call to string method Replace(string oldValue, string newValue). In fact, Replace will work better, because
it will replace all instances of the name, not just the first.
Also, should do the same for "Chuck" (Replace with firstName) and "Norris" (Replace with lastName) because some jokes use only those names, and not
the full name.

Line 53: GetNames() only returns a single name, so it should be called GetName()

Line 66: The requestUri should be "jokes/categories", not "categories".

Lines 21, 53, 61: Should not create a new HttpClient on each call. This can be created in the JsonFeed constructor and then just used 
in these methods.
